	  Jlibfprint was developed as part of a small project during our
	   studies at the University of Naples (Universit√† degli studi di
	   Napoli Federico II). It was not developed in the sight to 
	   provide a full support to the fingerprint sensors under Linux,
	   but just as basic access to these peripherals under Java.
